# About Me

{{ $image := resources.Get "images/author.png" }}

Hi there,

I’m **James Smith**, or as my online moniker goes, **“Smittix”**. The nick isn’t anything special—just a mixture of my surname and Unix. Boring, I know.

By day, I’m the **Head of Offensive Security** for an award-winning cyber security firm. I lead all things Offensive Security, and as an ethical hacker myself, I also get to break things from time to time.

I’m also a massive **Linux fanboy**, with a specific interest in the **Fedora Project**. I’ve been one of Fedora’s **UK ambassadors** for over a decade. I’ve been using Fedora since before its inception, having started out on one of Red Hat’s earlier releases (I think it was **Red Hat Linux 6**).

I got into computer security as a kid after seeing movies such as _Wargames_ and _Sneakers_. The whole concept fascinated me.

You’ll see that the blog has been neglected for a while due to me writing for the company I work for. However, I hope to **revive smittix.net this year**.

I hope some of these posts help some of you out there.

Enjoy,  
**Smittix**
