# Critical Vulnerability in CUPS Printing System

## Affected Software

Several components of the CUPS printing system, specifically:

- `cups-browsed`
- `libppd`
- `libcupsfilters`
- `cups-filters`

Affected versions: **Up to 2.0.1**

## Discovered By

**Simone Margaritelli** ([@evilsocket](https://twitter.com/evilsocket))

## Impact

**Remote Code Execution** on the affected system.

---

## What’s the Problem?

This vulnerability stems from how the CUPS system discovers printers on a network. The issue lies in the `cups-browsed` component, which automatically adds printers by scanning the network. Unfortunately, it doesn’t verify whether the discovered printer is legitimate or not.

This lack of verification allows an attacker to inject a **malicious printer** into the system, which can then execute arbitrary commands.

---

### Here’s How It Works

1. **Printer Discovery**  
   The `cups-browsed` service looks for printers using two protocols:
   - **UDP** on port 631
   - **DNS-SD/mDNS**

   It can receive responses from **untrusted sources**, even outside the local network if exposed to the internet.

2. **No Security Checks**  
   Once a printer is discovered, `cups-browsed` automatically contacts it and fetches its properties. These properties are saved to a temporary file **without any validation or sanitization**.

3. **Malicious Printer Properties**  
   An attacker can trick the system by setting specific printer properties, such as `printer-privacy-policy-uri`, to include **malicious code**. This unsanitized data is saved into the temporary printer configuration file.

4. **Code Execution**  
   When a print job is sent to the malicious printer, the system **executes the attacker’s code**. This can range from creating a file to full system compromise.

---

## How an Attacker Can Exploit It

An attacker can take advantage of this vulnerability in two ways:

- **Remote Attack**: If UDP port 631 is exposed to the internet, a malicious printer can be injected remotely.
- **Local Network Attack**: An attacker on the same network can use mDNS to deliver the payload.

Once the malicious printer is added, **any print job** sent to it can trigger arbitrary command execution.

---

## Example Exploit Scenario

1. The attacker sets up a **fake printer** on the network, configured to respond with **malicious data**.
2. `cups-browsed` discovers the printer, automatically adds it, and saves its configuration without performing any checks.
3. When the victim sends a print job, the **attacker’s commands are executed**, potentially leading to full system control.

---

## Fixing the Vulnerability

To mitigate this issue:

- **Disable Unnecessary Printer Discovery**  
  Turn off `cups-browsed` or block port 631 on your firewall if you don’t need network printer discovery.

- **Apply Patches**  
  The CUPS maintainers have been notified. Patches are likely to be released soon. Regularly check for updates from your distro’s package manager.

- **Network Segmentation**  
  Isolate printers on a **trusted network** and ensure **port 631 is not exposed** to the public internet.

---

## Conclusion

This vulnerability in CUPS could allow an attacker to **run arbitrary code** on your system simply by adding a **malicious printer**.

It underscores the importance of:

- Sanitizing network input
- Controlling access to network services like printers

Keep an eye out for security updates and consider hardening your CUPS configuration if you're in a vulnerable environment.
